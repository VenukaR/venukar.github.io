## Dengue Bot – LangChain PDF Question Answering System

Built a LangChain-based system that allows users to ask natural-language questions over dengue-related PDF documents. Uses embeddings and retrieval to provide contextual answers from structured sources.

### Key Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English about dengue information
- **PDF Document Processing**: Automatically extracts and indexes content from PDF sources
- **Contextual Answers**: Provides accurate, context-aware responses using embeddings
- **LangChain Integration**: Leverages LangChain for advanced document retrieval
- **Semantic Search**: Uses vector embeddings for intelligent information retrieval

### Technology Stack

- LangChain for orchestration
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- PDF processing and extraction
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

### Use Cases

Ideal for healthcare professionals, students, and researchers who need quick access to specific information from dengue-related documentation without manually searching through lengthy PDFs.
