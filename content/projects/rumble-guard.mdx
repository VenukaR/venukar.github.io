## Rumble Guard (Group Project)

Led development of a Flutter mobile application aimed at mitigating human–elephant conflict in Sri Lanka. Implemented seismic wave detection and deep learning models using TensorFlow to provide real-time elephant movement alerts.

### Key Features

- **Seismic Wave Detection**: Monitors ground vibrations to detect elephant movement
- **Deep Learning Models**: TensorFlow-powered AI for accurate elephant identification
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Instant notifications to communities about nearby elephants
- **Community Safety**: Helps prevent human-elephant conflicts in rural areas
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Flutter-based app for wide device compatibility

### Technology Stack

- Flutter for cross-platform mobile development
- TensorFlow for deep learning models
- Seismic sensor integration
- Real-time data processing
- Cloud-based alert system

### Problem Statement

Human-elephant conflict is a critical issue in Sri Lanka, causing loss of life and property. Rumble Guard provides an early warning system to protect both communities and elephants.

### Impact

Enables communities to take preventive measures when elephants are nearby, reducing conflicts while supporting elephant conservation efforts.

### Leadership Role

Led the development team, coordinating technical implementation and ensuring successful integration of AI models with mobile infrastructure.
