## Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive web-based visualization tool for understanding pathfinding algorithms. Demonstrates real-time navigation from start to end while avoiding obstacles using various classic algorithms.

### Supported Algorithms

- **A\* Search**: Optimal pathfinding with heuristics
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Guaranteed shortest path
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Exploratory traversal
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Layer-by-layer exploration
- **Greedy Best-First**: Heuristic-based rapid search

### Features

- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch algorithms explore the grid step-by-step
- **Interactive Grid**: Draw obstacles and customize start/end points
- **Algorithm Comparison**: See how different algorithms perform on the same problem
- **Educational Tool**: Perfect for learning algorithm behavior and performance
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all devices

### Technology Stack

- JavaScript for algorithm implementation
- HTML5 Canvas or SVG for visualization
- Interactive UI for user control

### Educational Value

Ideal for computer science students and educators to visualize and understand the differences between pathfinding algorithms in action.
